# Behavioral Hospital — React (Vite) Starter

## What's included
- Vite + React scaffold (source files under `src/`)
- React Router with pages: Home, About, Services
- Responsive CSS (plain CSS, mobile-first)
- Simple components: Navbar, Footer, Hero, ServiceCard

## To run locally
1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended) and npm.
2. In the project folder run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the dev URL (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Notes
- This is a starter scaffold intended for your internship project.
- You can replace icons/images in `src/components` and expand styles in `src/index.css`.
- If you'd like, I can convert styles to Tailwind CSS, add animations with Framer Motion, or prepare a deployment to Vercel/Netlify.
